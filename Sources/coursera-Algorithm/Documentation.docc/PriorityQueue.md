## Binary Heap

### Complete tree

Perfectly Balanced, except for bottom level.

#### Heap-ordered binary tree.
- Parent's key no smaller than children's Keys

#### Array representation
- Indices start at **1**
- Take nodes in level order
- **No explicit links needed**!

#### Binary heap properites

Proposition: Largest key is a[1], which is root of binary tree.

Proposition: Can use array indices to move through tree.

#### Promotion is a heap

#### Immutability: properities
